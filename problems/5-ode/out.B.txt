Problem 5B - SIR epidemic model

First model uses unhindered infection, 2.5 per infected, for two months
See plots in PlotB0.svg

Second model uses unhindered infection for 60 days.
This is followed by 540 days of harshly limited infection, 0.6 per infected.
See plots in PlotB1.svg

Third model uses unhindered infection for 60 days, 2.5 infections per infected.
This is followed by 60 days of harshly limited infection, 0.6 per infected.
This is followed by 480 days of semi-limited infection, 1.3 per infected.
See plots in PlotB2.svg

Fourth model uses unhindered 60d, 2.5 infections pr infected.
Followed by smooth transition to 60d harshly limited, 0.6 pr infected.
Followed by smoot transition to 60d 1 per infected, and then periodical 0.1 increase every 30d until 2.4.
See plot PlotB3.svg for it.
